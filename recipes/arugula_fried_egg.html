        Steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Make your pesto: in a food processor or magic bullet, blend the arugula, parmesan,<br> pine nuts, olive oil and garlic. Once blended, give it a taste test and adjust accordingly.<br> Some people prefer more/less garlic, saltiness etc. so give it a taste test before you call it done.</li><br>
            <li>Coat the bread in olive oil and crisp in a saut√© pan for 2-3 min per side on medium heat.<br> Once browned, remove from heat. In same pan, heat butter. Cook egg to your liking.<br> Season with salt and pepper.</li><br>
            <li>Spread as much pesto as you like on the toast and then add your pieces of prosciutto.<br> Top with fried egg, red pepper flakes and some parmesan. Enjoy!</li>
